# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Function

This repository showcases a common error in asynchronous Dart programming: neglecting proper exception handling in `async` functions. The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API. While it includes a `try-catch` block, the error handling is insufficient.  The solution demonstrates how to improve error handling for better application stability and resilience.

## Bug Description

The `fetchData` function in `bug.dart` fetches data from a URL.  If an error occurs (e.g., network issue, invalid API response), the `catch` block only prints an error message. The application continues, potentially with corrupted data or unexpected behavior. This lack of robust error handling can lead to unpredictable application behavior or crashes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file offers a more robust solution.  It enhances error handling by either:

1. **Rethrowing the exception**: allowing higher-level functions to handle the error appropriately.
2. **Returning an error value**: providing more context for downstream processing.
3. **Displaying a user-friendly error message**: enhancing the user experience.

Proper error handling is crucial for building reliable Dart applications.
